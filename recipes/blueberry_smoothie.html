    <p>Blueberry Smoothie</p>
    <p>This blueberry smoothie isn’t just good — it’s excellent! Made from a handful of simple ingredients, It’s perfectly frosty, packed with nutrients and antioxidants, and deliciously sweet, naturally.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>BLUEBERRY SMOOTHIE INGREDIENT NOTES</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Blueberries:</strong> To keep your smoothie chilled, it’s best to use frozen blueberries. If you have fresh blueberries on hand just pop them in the freezer for a few hours until frozen. </li>
        <li><strong>Banana:</strong> Again, I recommend using a frozen banana, and you can follow my methods for freezing bananas. But if you forgot to freeze yours, that’s fine. The smoothie will just be slightly less thick and chilled. </li>
        <li><strong>Coconut water:</strong> I love to use coconut water in smoothies because it’s loaded with electrolytes, it’s a great low-sugar alternative to fruit juice, and it’s a low-carb alternative to milk.</li>
        <li><strong>Greek yogurt:</strong> A staple ingredient for adding protein and beneficial gut-happy probiotics.</li>
        <li><strong>Flax seed:</strong> I’ve chatted about why I love flax seeds in my flax seed crackers recipe, but these little seeds are loaded with protein, fiber, and heart-healthy Omega-3s. They also help to thicken the smoothie up.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>HOW TO MAKE THIS BLUEBERRY SMOOTHIE</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Meal prep tip #1:</strong> Pack the exact amount of blueberries, sliced bananas, flaxseeds, and other add-ins into small freezer-safe sealable bags or containers and store them in the freezer for up to 3 months. Then all you need to do is pour the ingredients into the blender with the coconut water and Greek yogurt when you’re ready to enjoy.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Meal prep tip #2:</strong> If you want to avoid cleaning your blender multiple times, double the recipe and pour the other servings into freezer-safe mason jars (don’t forget to leave a little space at the top for expansion). These will last for up to 3 months in the freezer. When you’re ready to enjoy, let the jar thaw in the fridge overnight. Then give it a good shake before drinking!</li><br>
